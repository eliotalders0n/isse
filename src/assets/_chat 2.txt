[12/1/25, 8:16:57 AM] ~ Milicah Shonga: Happy new month! 

Just a quick Secret Santa reminder as we count down - we’re only a few days away from the SS deadline this Friday, and next week Friday we’re already off to Siavonga! 

Please make sure you’ve filled in something on the Secret Santa Google Sheet (even a simple “surprise me” works 👀). This helps your Secret Santa choose a gift for you - and ensures everyone gets something.

And once you’ve bought the gift for your person, please DM me first so we can arrange a discreet handover. Don’t drop it off at the office without checking in - we’re keeping the mystery alive. 😉
[12/1/25, 11:41:35 AM] ~ Tilyenji: We are not opening them in Siavonga?
[12/1/25, 11:52:53 AM] ~ Simunza Muyangana: ... but we already know what the gifts are 🙈
[12/1/25, 2:03:04 PM] ~ Milicah Shonga: 😬😬😬
[12/1/25, 2:08:41 PM] ~ Milicah Shonga: So………. Here’s the simple version that also caters to some who won’t travel with us. 

This year, no one is taking their gift straight to the venue.

You give your gift to me only, because I’m the neutral person who knows the Secret Santa list. This means, don’t give your gift to Naleli or Mary - why? Because that will break the system. 

I’m the one packing all the gifts together in one box for the trailer, so things are organised.

Since you’re coming from Copperbelt @⁨~Tilyenji⁩, you’re the only exception - you can give me your gift on Friday. Everyone else must give theirs earlier.

We’ll open all the gifts on Saturday during dinner.
[12/1/25, 2:11:12 PM] ~ Milicah Shonga: If your Secret Santa is not travelling, don’t worry - we’ll arrange to have their gift sent to them after the deadline. 😏
[12/1/25, 2:42:44 PM] ~ Simunza Muyangana: That's what I was told last year ... 😩
[12/1/25, 2:46:34 PM] ~ Milicah Shonga: This year, I got you. We are running a very strict regime 🙈😆
